This repo will save my notes when I read this book "LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (MICHAEL HUTH, MARK RYAN)".
I know this book when I learn subject "Mathematic modeling".

Link text book: https://github.com/LiuQBinh/LOGIC-IN-COMPUTER-SCIENCE-Modelling-and-Reasoning-about-Systems/blob/main/Huth%20and%20Ryan%20-%20Logic%20in%20computer%20science_%20modelling%20and%20reasoning%20about%20systems-Cambridge%20University%20Press%20(2004).pdf

Credo: I am only know that I don't know anything.
